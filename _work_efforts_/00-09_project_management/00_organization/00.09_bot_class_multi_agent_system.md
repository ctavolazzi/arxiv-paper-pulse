# Work Effort: Bot Class Multi-Agent System

## Status: Planning

## Objective
Create a `Bot` class that serves as a building block for a multi-agent iterative system. Each Bot instance represents a single AI unit with display capabilities, enabling agents to communicate, process inputs, and produce outputs in a structured iteration workflow.

## System Architecture

### Iteration Workflow
The system operates in iterative cycles with the following structure:

```
Iteration #: Iteration Title

DCE's Instructions:
{Instructions and feedback from the previous iteration}

Agent 1 Input:
{Agent 1 input}

Agent 2 Input:
{Agent 2 input}

Agent 3 Input:
{Agent 3 input}

CAE's Input:
{CAE's input}

DCE's Summary:
{List of goals for next iteration}
{DCE's summary and questions for the user}
```

### Agent Roles
- **DCE** (Design/Development Coordinator/Engine): Provides instructions, summarizes results, sets goals, asks user questions
- **Agent 1, 2, 3**: Process inputs and produce outputs
- **CAE** (Coordinator/Assistant Engine): Provides additional input/coordination

### Bot Class Design
The `Bot` class will be a reusable unit that:
- Encapsulates AI capabilities (using Gemini API)
- Provides display/output mechanism
- Manages state and context
- Follows "Direct & Minimal" coding principles

## Technical Requirements

### Bot Class Features
1. **AI Integration**: Direct Gemini API client usage (following existing pattern)
2. **Display/Output**: Mechanism for showing text/visual output
3. **State Management**: Internal state tracking
4. **Input/Output**: Methods to receive inputs and produce outputs
5. **Identity**: Each Bot instance has a name/role identifier

### Integration Points
- Use existing `config.py` for API key and model configuration
- Follow `ImageGenerator` and `DocumentProcessor` patterns for direct Gemini client usage
- Reuse existing Gemini API patterns from `core.py`

## Tasks
1. [ ] Design Bot class interface and methods
2. [ ] Implement Bot class with Gemini API integration
3. [ ] Implement display/output mechanism
4. [ ] Create multi-agent iteration orchestrator
5. [ ] Implement DCE, CAE, and Agent 1/2/3 as Bot instances
6. [ ] Create iteration workflow system
7. [ ] Add tests for Bot class
8. [ ] Add API endpoints for multi-agent system

## Progress
- [x] Work effort document created

## Next Steps
1. Clarify agent roles and responsibilities
2. Define display mechanism (text vs visual)
3. Design Bot class interface
4. Implement Bot class
5. Build multi-agent iteration system

## Notes
- Bot class should be a minimal, reusable building block
- Following "Direct & Minimal" coding style - no unnecessary abstractions
- Each agent (DCE, CAE, Agents 1/2/3) will be a Bot instance or use Bot as building block
- System should support iterative workflow with structured input/output
